"I may not be the biggest fan of your music, but I am forever a fan of you.

Thanks for being such a good sport with the internet.  It can be a hateful place, but you have inadvertently (or maybe it was your plan all along) created one of the longest-running, formidable, and hard to see coming memes/trolls of the digital age.

For that, we immortalize you in a way most people can only dream.  We thank you and we honor you at the same time.",[0]

A few years ago I discovered your songs (of course it's never gonna give you up) but, I liked it so much that I started listening to your songs, completely in love with them. I've listened to them all the time when I was going through a bad depression. Now in 20 years old, and I still love every single on of them.

"My brother had this Casio keyboard growing up. He never learned to play - any music produced was limited to Chopsticks and a general discordant plunking of notes for the most part. It had these sample songs available. Hit a button and the background music would start up, leaving you to fill in the lead vocals via keyboard. 

‚ÄúTogether Forever‚Äù was one of the sample songs, and the memory of that percussive opening still frequently blasts through my brain at random moments nearly 30 years later. 

Anyway. All that to say, my brain has for some reason decided that you and my brother shall be intrinsically linked for the rest of my life.",[0]
