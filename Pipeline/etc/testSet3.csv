Why should we give shots to perfectly healthy people who have had there shots when we could send them to other countries where it's hard to get the first two shots,1
"You may or may not be right, but your reasoning is completely beside the point. You should get a booster if and only if it is recommended by the public health professionals. It's their job to figure out what the best way to use the resources at their disposal is. You shouldn't try to figure out for yourself whether it's reasonable to use the resources that way, because you're not going to do a better job than they are when you don't have access to as much information, and you're not spending as much time on it.",1
Why should my tax dollars go for another kid's education? He has his own parents.,1
"As another person has pointed out, it is about prioritisation. In normal circumstances, hospitals don't generally have to prioritise some people over others, but Covid is a special circumstance where hospitals in some areas are often running at full capacities. In this case, people who made the effort to avoid the severe effects of covid should be prioritised. Also, may I point out that maintaining a healthy lifestyle or battling a smoking addiction is much harder than getting a shot or two.",1
"Most tables have four legs. However, some tables can have less than four.",0
This is a dangerous road to go down.,1
Glass water bottles are more efficient than metal ones. Glass is just a lot better at keeping the heat in.,1

They say you only come to peace with yourself when you know yourself better than those around you. Derick knew nothing about this. He thought he had found peace but this was an illusion as he was about to find out with an unexpected occurrence that he actually knew nothing about himself.,0
"Eating raw fish didn't sound like a good idea. It's a delicacy in Japan, didn't seem to make it any more appetizing. Raw fish is raw fish, delicacy or not.",1
"There was little doubt that the bridge was unsafe. All one had to do was look at it to know that with certainty. Yet Bob didn't see another option. He may have been able to work one out if he had a bit of time to think things through, but time was something he didn't have. A choice needed to be made, and it needed to be made quickly.",0
"Boiled or microwaved veggies absolutely suck and are the laziest way to cook them. If you Sautéed those bad boys in butter, roasted or grilled them with some actual seasoning, then your kids would have a grand old time eating them and you wouldn't have to threaten them with no play time while they sit there and throw up in their mouth. Stop torturing your kids and learn to cook.",1
Sea horses are the worst type of fish. They evolve tails to make up for the fact they dont have fins. Such a stupid species,1

Cremate them all and be done with it.",1
"It's a well known fact that there are over 400,000 children in foster care, and in 2017 alone over 100,000 infants under 3 entered the system. I think it's completely entitled and self-absorbed to think that somehow your miracle baby is worth more or deserves more love than any one of those infants.",1
"Movies, shows and books are created at a certain time and place that cannot be changed. So calling them problematic is like looking at a picture of yourself when you were young and saying how bad your clothes look by today's standards, when at the time you were stylish. People calling something problematic is just virtue signaling. I think many older pieces of media are racist, homphobic or misogynistic, but they can't be changed and they can't be held to today's standards.",1
"Chippers are the crispiest, crunchiest, and most delicious brand of chips you will ever taste. Buy a bag today.",1
"A Lexi Mattress is the most comfortable bed you’ll ever sleep on. Take a 30-day trial and see for yourself. If you’re not satisfied, we’ll come to your home, remove the mattress, and refund you in full. You’ve got nothing to lose. Give it a try today.",1
"The death penalty is a good deterrent for criminals. Beyond that, it is fair because the Bible supports an eye for an eye. We need to keep the death penalty on the books.",1
Marijuana should be legalized. We are putting too many people in prison and spending too much money to incarcerate them for nonviolent crimes.,1

"To the surprise of everyone, the Rapture happened yesterday but it didn't quite go as expected.",0
Most shark attacks occur about 10 feet from the beach since that's where the people are.,0
"Arthur felt like the odd one in the room, the only human member of the congress being forced to listen to the ramblings of aliens, each one discussing his race in the same way a human would discuss a rather naughty breed of dog. He half expected the senator Jixl Masu to tell him to sit and roll over at the end of her rousing speech on humanity.",0
"My three decades of experience in public service, my tireless commitment to the people of this community, and my willingness to reach across the aisle and cooperate with the opposition, make me the ideal candidate for your mayor.",1
Peter always saw the world in black and white. There were two choices for every situation and you had to choose one of them. It was therefore terribly uncomfortable for him to spend time with Ashley. She saw the world in shades of gray with hundreds of choices to choose from in every situation.,0
"The spot was perfect for camouflage. At least that's what she thought when she picked the spot. She couldn't imagine that anyone would ever be able to see her in these surroundings. So there she sat, confident that she was hidden from the world and safe from danger. Unfortunately, she had not anticipated that others may be looking upon her from other angles, and now they were stealthily descending toward her hiding spot.",0
"Don't forget that gifts often come with costs that go beyond their purchase price. When you purchase a child the latest smartphone, you're also committing to a monthly phone bill. When you purchase the latest gaming system, you're likely not going to be satisfied with the games that come with it for long and want to purchase new titles to play. When you buy gifts it's important to remember that some come with additional costs down the road that can be much more expensive than the initial gift itself.",0
"Ten more steps. If he could take ten more steps it would be over, but his legs wouldn't move. He tried to will them to work, but they wouldn't listen to his brain. Ten more steps and it would be over but it didn't appear he would be able to do it.",0
"It had been a simple realization that had changed Debra's life perspective. It was really so simple that she was embarrassed that she had lived the previous five years with the way she measured her worth. Now that she saw what she had been doing, she could see how sad it was. That made her all the more relieved she had made the change. The number of hearts her Instagram posts received wasn't any longer the indication of her own self-worth.",0
"They had made it to Las Vegas, wide-eyed and with so much hope and energy. They had planned the trip for more than a year and both were so excited they could barely control themselves. They still hadn't realized that Las Vegas promised a place where dreams come true, it was actually the place where dreams came to die.",0
"You know me - I've taught Sunday School at your church for years, babysat your children, and served as a playground director for many summers - so you know I can run your preschool.",1
"Our expertise in roofing contracting is evidenced not only by our 50 years in the business and our staff of qualified technicians, but in the decades of satisfied customers who have come to expect nothing but the best.",1
"But tonight, we turn the page. Tonight, after a breakthrough year for America, our economy is growing and creating jobs at the fastest pace since 1999. Our unemployment rate is now lower than it was before the financial crisis. More of our kids are graduating than ever before. More of our people are insured than ever before. And we are as free from the grip of foreign oil as we’ve been in almost 30 years.",1
"Based on the dozens of archaeological expeditions I've made all over the world, I am confident that those potsherds are Mesopotamian in origin.",1

"Colors bounced around in her head. They mixed and threaded themselves together. Even colors that had no business being together. They were all one, yet distinctly separate at the same time. How was she going to explain this to the others?",0
"They had always called it the green river. It made sense. The river was green. The river likely had a different official name, but to everyone in town, it was and had always been the green river. So it was with great surprise that on this day the green river was a fluorescent pink.",0
"She has seen this scene before. It had come to her in dreams many times before. She had to pinch herself to make sure it wasn't a dream again. As her fingers squeezed against her arm, she felt the pain. It was this pain that immediately woke her up.",0
There was a reason for her shyness. Everyone assumed it had always been there but she knew better. She knew the exact moment that the shyness began. It had been that fateful moment at the lake. There are just some events that do that to you.,0
"He couldn't remember exactly where he had read it, but he was sure that he had. The fact that she didn't believe him was quite frustrating as he began to search the Internet to find the article. It wasn't as if it was something that seemed impossible. Yet she insisted on always seeing the source whenever he stated a fact.",0
"The wave crashed and hit the sandcastle head-on. The sandcastle began to melt under the waves force and as the wave receded, half the sandcastle was gone. The next wave hit, not quite as strong, but still managed to cover the remains of the sandcastle and take more of it away. The third wave, a big one, crashed over the sandcastle completely covering and engulfing it. When it receded, there was no trace the sandcastle ever existed and hours of hard work disappeared forever.",0
"He took a sip of the drink. He wasn't sure whether he liked it or not, but at this moment it didn't matter. She had made it especially for him so he would have forced it down even if he had absolutely hated it. That's simply the way things worked. She made him a new-fangled drink each day and he took a sip of it and smiled, saying it was excellent.",0
The computer wouldn't start. She banged on the side and tried again. Nothing. She lifted it up and dropped it to the table. Still nothing. She banged her closed fist against the top. It was at this moment she saw the irony of trying to fix the machine with violence.,0
I'm heading back to Colorado tomorrow after being down in Santa Barbara over the weekend for the festival there. I will be making October plans once there and will try to arrange so I'm back here for the birthday if possible.
