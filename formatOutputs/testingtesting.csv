"I am not going to address the rare adult who shoots up a school. I am only addressing children who bring guns to schools.

1. It is a fact that the cerebral frontal cortex of the human brain -- the part of the brain that is responsible for rational thought, executive function, and mediating emotional outbursts is not fully developed [until the mid-20](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3621648/)s. Since school shooters are typically adolescence, you are advocating executing individuals who are not **physically** capable of being fully in control of their actions nor do they have the physical neural structures necessary to **fully comprehend** the implications of their structures. That seems grossly unjust to me.
2. Studies of offenders' have indicated a much h[igher level of lack of supervision, emotional closeness, and intimacy](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jip.1439) than in the general public. You are suggesting killing a child for a parent's lack of parenting skill.
3. The shootings couldn't have happened without guns. in 80% of the cases, [guns are taken from the home.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/local/wp/2018/08/01/feature/school-shootings-should-parents-be-charged-for-failing-to-lock-up-guns-used-by-their-kids/) Again, you are suggesting killing a child because an adult failed to secure a weapon.
4. [Being a victim of bullying is a recurring theme](https://www.ojp.gov/ncjrs/virtual-library/abstracts/behind-scenes-closer-look-school-shooters) for school shooters.  75% or more of school shooters have been victims of bullying. Again, this means adults failed to protect a child, who then decided they needed to protect themselves. Inappropriately, certainly.

"I think you really need to think about age here. What if the shooter was 8. This is a child who does not have the capacity to understand what they've done. Do you really think the state should kill an 8 year old? What about 10? Maybe you have a case with over 15 but middle schoolers and elementary school children.  I cannot,  regardless of crime, think that it would be ok to execute a child. Imagine what that would look like.  Have you seen a child in court? Have you seen the rooms that executions happen in? Imagine a child sitting/lying in the chair/bed with a roomful of people watching them die. There are reasons we don't have capital punishments for mentally handicapped people and insane people. Children fall into the same category of not having the full mental capacity to realize how wrong something actually is. I would even argue that if you have the capacity to watch a child be executed that there is something wrong with you. 

There are other arguments that have been said already but op doesn't want to admit they are wrong and isn't actually thinking about the weight of the other arguments.

However, in some cases where a student murders another student on school grounds and targets only targets a specific individual. That should be treated as any other murder case and the fact it was carried out in a school is irrelevant.

"Ahh so the law will be, “only people that shoot up schools will potentially face corporal punishment,” because that’s logical to draw the line right there and nowhere else. 

Walk into an airport with a machine gun and start shooting… jail time; bomb a school or daycare…. jail time; kidnap, rape and murder 10 children… jail time…etc

Only in circumstances when there is a school shooting and the shooter can be unmistakably identified will they face the death penalty. 

IMO you either support the death penalty or you don’t. If you choose to support it, the only logical way to do that would be on a case-by-case basis. Criminality is so subjective, there is no way to define all potential atrocities and predetermine if they merit or do not merit corporal punishment.

Here is a counter example to a school shooting meriting the death penalty. What if you go to high school in a more dangerous part of a large city with some gang activity and definitely some students in gangs. One day, a fight breaks out between two kids, members of rival gangs and one of them pulls a pistol and kills the other kid, turns and runs never to attend HS again.

Second, most crimes are a failure of government and lawmakers to address real grievances of its citizens. Look at Norway for example, they have a famously lax punishment system and yet their crime rate is pretty low. School shootings is a particularly American problem, so there's got to be an underlying issue. Maybe it's the prevalence of guns, or zero tolerance policies that punish the bullied, or lack of meaningful mental health services.

"1. School shooters are not charged with ""School Shooting"" but rather homicide, manslaughter if they are successful and conspiracy to commit if they are caught before hand. So the prosecution would have to prove these charges using camera footage or eyewitness testimony, because due process. So the type and level of evidience required to prove intention, not the act of school shooting itself, will set the precedent for future death penalty cases. This would lead to a blanket death penalty law, that is not restricted only to school shooters.
2. Death penalty is not a deterrent. No future school shooter, a large portion of whom are both homicidal and suicidal, will pause his/her plans because there is chance he might survive and be put on death row.
3. Simiar to how death penalty can increase the number of homicides of sexual assault victims (because of fear of identification) school shooters will simply be more savage and brazen in their attacks to trigger law enforcement towards suicide by cops.
4. School shooting, is not just an individual problem. It is a cultural and societal problem. While the prepetrator is liable for his/her actions, death penalty shifts the blame solely on the prepetrator without addressing root causes.
5. Death penalty is not a singular issue too. It is the culture that needs to be pulled out root and stem. Saying death penalty is alright for this crime and not for that crime, simply shifts the onus of broadening its implementation to a future (possibly more tyrannical) government.

In fact, guaranteeing the death penalty might actually see an uptick in the number of school shootings you've now created a very definite outcome to the scenario - This is the same reason that schools had to stop holding big, flashy memorial ceremonies for kids who committed suicide, because it was inspiring a ton of copycat deaths. 

On top of that, we also obviously don't understand that much about the specifics of how and why these shootings occur and how to prevent them. Yes, functionally unrestricted access to guns is a huge factor, but guns only enable the issue, they don't build the circumstances that lead to it. People don't just wake up one day and decide to throw their whole life away for 15 minutes of infamy. Leaving them alive in jail gives psychologists and psychiatrists a chance to work with them and establish a pattern that allows us to address these issues in others before they occur, and will save lives in the long run. As counterintuitive as it sounds to get school shooters help, they're going to be much more likely to open up and discuss the critically important specifics if their mental state improves.",1,38.51091142490372,25.673940949935815,32.976829268292676,41,509,540
"It is not legally justifiable, correct. 

It's not a good or healthy response, correct. 

However, I believe that it's important for a good society to consider the mental state of the individual (generally children) that commits the crime, as well as their motive, and the facts of the offense.

I will start by saying that I'm against the death penalty for a variety of reasons, but I believe general arguments against the death penalty have been argued elsewhere.

I think it's important to look at things from the perspectives of the children that are bullied (not all victims retaliate by shooting their attacker, but the analysis is still relevant). These are individuals, often going through significant physical, mental, and emotional changes. We acknowledge that children do not generally have the same level of control as adults (why we have juvenile court, often considered a rehabilitative system, and adult court). 

Taken to the extreme (as your view encompasses all such situations without exception), they are being targeted and attacked on a daily basis, they don't have the coping mechanisms and understanding to know who they can turn to and how they can get help. The adults in charge may not know about what is going on, they may not know about the child's mental state, and they may not have the knowledge or resources to assist. This can eat away at their mental state of any person, causing PTSD, which may be comparable to BWS in some cases (a legal defense in some jurisdictions). This can go on for days, weeks, or months of constant harassment. In some cases, they lash out my committing suicide, running away, or attacking their attackers.

Do we adjust our punishment based on the mental state of the individual at the time of the offense? As a society, we have decided the the majority of our criminal laws require an examination of an individual's intent to commit an offense, and often their motive and mental state. There are numerous situations where the legal syste",1,13.333333333333334,46.666666666666664,35.05,42,509,540

"""Capital punishment is an issue where innocent people get unjustly killed without a chance to repeal their sentence""

I'd argue that this is not necessarily the only issue with capital punishment. This is because capital punishment assumes the state has the right to take life away at all. It may be argued that an individual's right to life trumps the right of a state to punish an individual/protect others from this individual. While you may argue that the state has a right to individual x's life (the school shooter) since x has killed a and b. It does not necessarily follow that c (the state) should kill x since x killed a and b. 'Justice' doesn't necessarily transfer like this. You killing your mothers murderer doesn't negate the murder of your mother, it just makes you a murderer too.

Also, the contexts within which school shootings take place are incredibly complex. It is also noteworthy that school shootings are mostly a uniquely American issue. This points to possibly societal or structural reasons for the violence. Should an individual be killed for something they possibly would not have done had they grown up in another country? Teenage brains are also essentially different to adult ones, with the prefrontal cortex which controls reasoning not being fully developed. This is why teenagers and children are not tried the same as adults as they are not deemed truly fully responsible for their actions. There are all sorts of contexts that increase or decrease the likelihood of x becoming a school shooter or not. At the age at which someone is at school,  they are uniquely effected by their upbringing, environment, peers and brain in which an adult is not.

"Under the ""evolving standards of decency"" test, the Court held that it was cruel and unusual punishment to execute a person who was under the age of 18 at the time of the murder. Writing for the majority, Justice Kennedy cited a body of sociological and scientific research[1] that found that juveniles have a lack of maturity and sense of responsibility compared to adults. Adolescents were found to be over-represented statistically in virtually every category of reckless behavior. The Court noted that in recognition of the comparative immaturity and irresponsibility of juveniles, almost every state prohibited those under age 18 from voting, serving on juries, or marrying without parental consent. The studies also found that juveniles are more vulnerable to negative influences and outside pressures, including peer pressure. They have less control, or experience with control, over their own environment. They also lack the freedom that adults have, to escape a criminogenic setting.[10]

In support of the ""national consensus"" position, the Court noted that states were reducing the frequency by which they applied capital punishment to juvenile offenders. At the time of the decision, 20 states had the juvenile death penalty on the books, but only six states had executed prisoners since 1989 for crimes committed as juveniles. Only three states had done so since 1994: Oklahoma, Texas, and Virginia. Furthermore, five of the states that allowed the juvenile death penalty at the time of the 1989 case had since abolished it.

The Court also looked to practices in other countries to support the holding. Between 1990 and the time of the case, the court said, ""only seven countries other than the United States ha[d] executed juvenile offenders ... : Iran, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and China."" Justice Kennedy noted that since 1990, each of those countries had either abolished the death penalty for juveniles or made public disavowal ",1,46.992481203007515,40.72681704260651,11.024912280701754,150,509,540

For example, our teacher who is 34 literally admitted to us that she would constantly bully people with glasses when she was our age, but now she is the nicest teacher ever and is the most helpful when dealing with bullying at our school. Nobody blames her for bullying in the past because she was a dumb kid back then and now she is a redeemed adult who regrets her actions and fight against bullying.

"I'm going to start off with a a refutation of your point on technical rather than moral grounds but transition into a moral/legal critique.  First, it's worth noting that ""school shooter"" isn't, strictly speaking, a specific crime.  If Jimmy brings his dad's pistol to school, gets into a fight, and shoots some guy in the leg he's a ""school shooter"" but that's pretty obviously not what you mean.

So I think what you're really arguing is that mass shooters -- that is to say spree killers -- should get the death penalty.  Specifically, you're arguing that spree killers should get the death penalty because...

1. There is no doubt that they did what they did.  I'm assuming this is because you're imagining that all spree killers either kill themselves at the end of the shooting (rendering the point moot) or are taken into police custody surrounded by bodies with a gun in their hands.

2. The crime they committed is irredeemable and reform isn't possible/worth it.

Let's take those two one at a time.

First, no, not all spree killers are arrested on the spot with no question of their guilt.  [Here's a kid who opened fire on his class-mates, fled the scene, and was arrested hours later](https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/texas-high-school-lockdown-amid-reports-shooting-80434835).  Are we 100% sure it's the same kid?  Not mostly sure -- 100% sure.  Is there no scenario however improbable that the cops got the wrong guy?  I don't know.  And he's certainly not the only one; just the first result when I searched for ""school shooter arrested hours later.""  

But even if someone were arrested surrounded by shell casings and bodies, are we STILL sure they're the shooter?  Kids are supposed to have guns at school but they obviously do sometimes. Is it possible the person the police bring into custody was the proverbial ""good guy with the gun?""  Is it possible the actual shooter is dead?  That we're about to execute the person who stopped the shooting?

Now imagine, unbeknownst to anyone, that it was actually fellow student Bob Jones that perpetrated the shooting--he had bought that coat specifically for the shooting and the cheap security cameras didn't clearly show other information that would have identified Bob.

People think it's cheaper, but it's not at all. You can easily google this and find a number of sources saying the same. It costs a whole lot more to execute someone than to keep them imprisoned, even if it's for their whole life. In fact, some states ended the death penalty for no reason other than it costs too much money to execute people.

The short reason is, if the state is going to execute someone, it's probably best to be really, really, absolutely, no doubt about it, 100% sure that the person you're killing is guilty. That requires very expensive trials. It requires the state fund a very good death penalty defense lawyer in most cases, because leaving it up to just some random public defender could lead to people being executed because they don't have money to defend themselves. And then we need to allow for a lengthy appeals process because there's always the case that they don't get a fair trial for whatever reason. In short it costs quite a bit more money to execute people than just send them to prison.

The whole ""Let's just take them out back and put a bullet in their head."" isn't really a great idea. We used to do that, it was called lynching. And we seemed to not have a great record of killing people who deserved it. It was cheap, but a whole lot of innocent black men died because a white person accused them of something even when there was little to no evidence of it.

You’re talking about something different. If the prosecution levees the wrong charges then they’re not guilty of those charges.. that’s.. way way different.",1,66.66666666666667,9.523809523809526,23.809523809523814,513,509,540
">You don’t get to decide this for me

My apologies then. Why do you not want the government to have this power?

>The idea you could shoot begging and crying people without any consequence to their emotional state is retarded

If the crocodile tears of murderers is so troubling to people, then the process could be automated relatively easily. 

>We should rehabilitate people

The purpose of laws is not only to rehabilitate, but also to punish and provide a reason why people shouldn’t commit crimes.

In the case of crimes with victims, crimes directly against others, there is no rehabilitation. Pedos don’t deserve rehabilitation. Rapists don’t deserve rehabilitation. Neither do murderers, and especially not mass-murderers. These people know what they did was wrong. All people know it is wrong. The fact that they did it despite the social conditioning that drills into people the fact that murder is *wrong,* that means that either the society has failed in diverting them from murder, or that they are irredeemable. How can someone who has killed multiple people for no good reason ever hope to give back to society, nevermind giving back for the amount of money spent on rehabilitating them?",1,21.929824561403507,43.859649122807014,23.80421052631579,514,509,540

"I want the government to serve its function, it's function should never be to murder people, to torture people or to sell people.

School shooters can have real emotions, you calling their tears at the expectation of death 'crocodile tears' speaks volumes of your inability to still see these people as human. You're free to not see them as human but I think you're overestimating what humans are, and it feels pointless to try to convince you to entertain alternative trains of thought when your current one seems so 'gut instinct and nothing more'. 

The person who designs the automated murder machine and the people who build and install it are humans. They can be just as traumatized as the executioner. Nothing about this is 'simple', proven by the fact that the current system of executions is already incredibly faulty.

">I don’t see them as human because they aren’t human. They gunned down innocent people for no good reason. How can anyone see them as human?

You got it backwards, they didn't 'disqualify' themselves from being human, it's the other way around. A part of being human is that humans are varied, and some kill others. Besides that, you can't study them if they're dead, and killing them doesn't change anythign when compared to emprisoning them, except that killing them is much more expensive. Your solution of 'just make it cheaper/automated/easier' is ignorant, there is *nobody* on the opposing side, yet the problem exists.

Also, executions are already happening at 'the press of a button', they *already are* as automated as you can reasonably expect, and yet trauma *already is* rampant.

>I don’t doubt there would be many people who would be willing to pull the trigger on those subhumans.

You don't doubt that because you haven't done it. Executioners repeatedly have the same idea beforehand, then thoroughly regret so after a few years.

>People aren’t immediately overtaken by PTSD the moment they lay their eyes on a machine designed to kill people.

Good thing I said something pretty far removed from that ridiculous generalisation then. 

Read *Perpetration-Induced Traumatic Stress: The Psychological Consequences of Killing* by Rachel MacNair. Watch the documentary *Into the Abyss*. These aren't media made to dissuade you from wanting mass-murderers to be dead, they serve to inform you of the consequences of assigning executioners. Stop trying to rationalise this, you have no actual frame of reference, you can't 'imagine' the consequences of being an executioner with any validity.

Read [this](https://www.salon.com/2015/10/08/i_executed_62_people_im_sorry_an_executioner_turned_death_penalty_opponent_tells_all/) article at the very least, if you don't want to put any real effort in informing yourself.
