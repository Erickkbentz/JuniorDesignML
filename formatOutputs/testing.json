This is because capital punishment assumes the state has the right to take life away at all. It may be argued that an individual's right to life trumps the right of a state to punish an individual\/protect others from this individual. While you may argue that the state has a right to individual x's life (the school shooter) since x has killed a and b. It does not necessarily follow that c (the state) should kill x since x killed a and b. 'Justice' doesn't necessarily transfer like this. You killing your mothers murderer doesn't negate the murder of your mother, it just makes you a murderer too.\n\nAlso, the contexts within which school shootings take place are incredibly complex. It is also noteworthy that school shootings are mostly a uniquely American issue. This points to possibly societal or structural reasons for the violence. Should an individual be killed for something they possibly would not have done had they grown up in another country? Teenage brains are also essentially different to adult ones, with the prefrontal cortex which controls reasoning not being fully developed. This is why teenagers and children are not tried the same as adults as they are not deemed truly fully responsible for their actions. There are all sorts of contexts that increase or decrease the likelihood of x becoming a school shooter or not. At the age at which someone is at school,  they are uniquely effected by their upbringing, environment, peers and brain in which an adult is not. I personally would extend this argument against capital punishment to adults too, but I hope you can see how this is especially applicable to the age range in which school shootings happen.","containsPersuasion":1,"Logos_Class":18.691588785,"Ethos_Class":32.7102803738,"Pathos_Class":44.1721495327,"id":75,"numPersuasive":509,"numTotal":540}

{"body":"Under the \"evolving standards of decency\" test, the Court held that it was cruel and unusual punishment to execute a person who was under the age of 18 at the time of the murder. Writing for the majority, Justice Kennedy cited a body of sociological and scientific research[1] that found that juveniles have a lack of maturity and sense of responsibility compared to adults. Adolescents were found to be over-represented statistically in virtually every category of reckless behavior. The Court noted that in recognition of the comparative immaturity and irresponsibility of juveniles, almost every state prohibited those under age 18 from voting, serving on juries, or marrying without parental consent. The studies also found that juveniles are more vulnerable to negative influences and outside pressures, including peer pressure. They have less control, or experience with control, over their own environment. They also lack the freedom that adults have, to escape a criminogenic setting.[10]\n\nIn support of the \"national consensus\" position, the Court noted that states were reducing the frequency by which they applied capital punishment to juvenile offenders. At the time of the decision, 20 states had the juvenile death penalty on the books, but only six states had executed prisoners since 1989 for crimes committed as juveniles. Only three states had done so since 1994: Oklahoma, Texas, and Virginia. Furthermore, five of the states that allowed the juvenile death penalty at the time of the 1989 case had since abolished it.\n\nThe Court also looked to practices in other countries to support the holding. Between 1990 and the time of the case, the court said, \"only seven countries other than the United States ha[d] executed juvenile offenders ... : Iran, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and China.\" Justice Kennedy noted that since 1990, each of those countries had either abolished the death penalty for juveniles or made public disavowal ","containsPersuasion":1,"Logos_Class":46.992481203,"Ethos_Class":40.7268170426,"Pathos_Class":11.0249122807,"id":150,"numPersuasive":509,"numTotal":540}

{"body":"I was going to respond to all of the people responding to you saying how it's cheaper to kill them, but there's so many who are making this mistake that I thought I'd reply to the parent comment instead. People think it's cheaper, but it's not at all. You can easily google this and find a number of sources saying the same. It costs a whole lot more to execute someone than to keep them imprisoned, even if it's for their whole life. In fact, some states ended the death penalty for no reason other than it costs too much money to execute people.\n\nThe short reason is, if the state is going to execute someone, it's probably best to be really, really, absolutely, no doubt about it, 100% sure that the person you're killing is guilty. That requires very expensive trials. It requires the state fund a very good death penalty defense lawyer in most cases, because leaving it up to just some random public defender could lead to people being executed because they don't have money to defend themselves. And then we need to allow for a lengthy appeals process because there's always the case that they don't get a fair trial for whatever reason. In short it costs quite a bit more money to execute people than just send them to prison.\n\nThe whole \"Let's just take them out back and put a bullet in their head.\" isn't really a great idea. We used to do that, it was called lynching. And we seemed to not have a great record of killing people who deserved it. It was cheap, but a whole lot of innocent black men died because a white person accused them of something even when there was little to no evidence of it.\n\nIn short: a death penalty case costs far more than a life imprisonment case. A death penalty case is not something you want to attempt to get done on the cheap. So, as long as we're not executing people after a speedy trial with haphazard jury selection with a defense lawyer just out of law school and allowing no appeals process, the costs will stay very high.","containsPersuasion":1,"Logos_Class":40.733197556,"Ethos_Class":15.2749490835,"Pathos_Class":39.4593686354,"id":367,"numPersuasive":509,"numTotal":540}

{"body":">I don\u2019t see them as human because they aren\u2019t human. They gunned down innocent people for no good reason. How can anyone see them as human?\n\nYou got it backwards, they didn't 'disqualify' themselves from being human, it's the other way around. A part of being human is that humans are varied, and some kill others. Besides that, you can't study them if they're dead, and killing them doesn't change anythign when compared to emprisoning them, except that killing them is much more expensive. Your solution of 'just make it cheaper\/automated\/easier' is ignorant, there is *nobody* on the opposing side, yet the problem exists.\n\nAlso, executions are already happening at 'the press of a button', they *already are* as automated as you can reasonably expect, and yet trauma *already is* rampant.\n\n>I don\u2019t doubt there would be many people who would be willing to pull the trigger on those subhumans.\n\nYou don't doubt that because you haven't done it. Executioners repeatedly have the same idea beforehand, then thoroughly regret so after a few years.\n\n>People aren\u2019t immediately overtaken by PTSD the moment they lay their eyes on a machine designed to kill people.\n\nGood thing I said something pretty far removed from that ridiculous generalisation then. \n\nRead *Perpetration-Induced Traumatic Stress: The Psychological Consequences of Killing* by Rachel MacNair. Watch the documentary *Into the Abyss*. These aren't media made to dissuade you from wanting mass-murderers to be dead, they serve to inform you of the consequences of assigning executioners. Stop trying to rationalise this, you have no actual frame of reference, you can't 'imagine' the consequences of being an executioner with any validity.\n\nRead [this](https:\/\/www.salon.com\/2015\/10\/08\/i_executed_62_people_im_sorry_an_executioner_turned_death_penalty_opponent_tells_all\/) article at the very least, if you don't want to put any real effort in informing yourself.
